# CodeTest
This is a Java program to sum up input alpha characters to integer values.  I wrote this for a code test I did in the fall of 2022.  

Requirement:

Write a program to sum up the characters in a username.  Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a value, A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on.

Non alphabet characters are not used in the final sum.

Functionality:
- Prompt user for username
- For each character in the username sum up the correlated integer value.
- Display the username and the sum.


Sample output:

C:\dev\code\prototypes\java\CodeTest\out\production\CodeTest>java CodeTest

Enter username

Jack Rief

Username value: Jack Rief = 63

C:\dev\code\prototypes\java\CodeTest\out\production\CodeTest>java CodeTest

Enter username

Jack Rief *()_&&%

Username value: Jack Rief *()_&&% = 63
